# Multilingual Voice-Based AI Assistant using Google Gemini LLM 🤖

🌟 Overview

This project is a multilingual voice-enabled AI assistant that combines cutting-edge generative AI with speech processing to interact naturally with users. Speak, and the assistant will transcribe your voice to text, generate intelligent responses using Google Gemini LLM (DeepMind), and respond back in clear audio.

It supports English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and 50+ other languages, making it highly versatile and accessible.

Designed to be robust, interactive, and user-friendly, with a sleek Streamlit UI for seamless interaction.
