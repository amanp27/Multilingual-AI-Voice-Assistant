# 🎙️ Multilingual Voice-Based AI Assistant using Google Gemini LLM 🤖

🌟 Overview

This project is a voice-enabled AI assistant that combines cutting-edge generative AI with speech processing to interact naturally with users. Speak, and the assistant will transcribe your voice to text, generate intelligent responses using Google Gemini LLM (DeepMind), and respond back in clear audio.

Designed to be robust, interactive, and user-friendly, with a sleek Streamlit UI for seamless interaction.
